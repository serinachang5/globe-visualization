Description
Today, we have greater and better access to data from all over the world, and we can retrieve it within seconds. Global data can illuminate problems that would be hard to see from our local standpoints, and connect us to people continents away. My app, a visualization of violence against women around the globe, aims to use data to this end, addressing a pertinent and awful issue that is rarely brought to light. Even the women who are affected by such violence do not feel able to open conversation about their situation: in fact, the UN reports that over 60 percent of women who experience violence do not seek any sort of help. This is further exacerbated by the prevalence of violence inflicted by intimate partners, as it is often much harder to reach out behind closed doors. My app thus reaches out for these women, bringing digital visibility to their hidden struggle.
Build
I wrote a program in Python (make-json.py) to extract the relevant pieces of information from the UN Nation's report, convert the countries in latitude/longitude coordinates, and build the json file (mysearch.json). I wrote in HTML (index.html) to create a WebGL globe that visualized my data, and also included relevant files from WebGL's public repo in mine. I developed on GitHub and Heroku using the command line.
